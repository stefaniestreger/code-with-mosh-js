// Write a function that countBs() that takes a string as it's only argument
// Return a number that indicates how many uppercase "B" characters there are in the string

// Write another function countChar() that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument
// This second argument indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than just uppercase Bs
// Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function
